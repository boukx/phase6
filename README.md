# Bouk's Phase 6 Lootapalooza ![](./skinnay_rip.png)

The base of this document is ripped directly from  [Skinnay's Classic Gear List](https://gist.github.com/skinnay-dev/39f71f3cce1c64b95142f7e0e0d97bca), modified slightly, and updated to fit our current understanding of hunters in classic.  Please see his list for pre-phase 6 gear lists.

Phase 6 BiS is much simpler than previous phases as T3 is far and away better than most other gear in the game.  [Stat weights](#P6-eAP) and dps values are based on [Sixx's DPS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlB2P1kyV_QdD4ULQzvZvS6hK6BDouUQkyHQzCvBGI/edit#gid=333718892) and assume full buffs, consumables, and uptime on boss debuffs with 20/31/0 spec<!-- Todo link config -->. Weapon calculations assume absolute BiS armor and likewise, armor calculations assume absolutely BiS weapons.  DPS numbers are from stable rotations without use of haste effects or active trinkets. 

As these sets are being simmed under pretty contrived settings (100% debuff, pet uptime, etc) the absolute DPS values of each set is fairly meaningless.  Gear upgrades should be compared relative to the pieces and sets they are replacing.  Likewise, Blessing of Kings (and Windfury when weaving) raises the top end DPS of all sets but do not meaningfully change how the sets compare to eachother.  As such, all sets are simmed with Blessing of Kings.  We've put the simmed DPS of top end weave sets with Windfury (WF) in the notes column because melee hits go brrrrt.

Phase 6 introduces [Consecrated Sharpening Stones.
](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23122/consecrated-sharpening-stone)  Our current best knowledge indicates these work for ranged AP as well as melee.  As such, we've simmed all sets with them applied (except WF sims).

<!-- We assume [20/31/0](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/53000200505-05251030513051) due to Slaying talents affecting very few raid bosses in Naxx and AQ rather than the p3/4 [13/31/7](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/530002003-05251030513051-32002) spec. -->


## P6 eAP

## Upgrading to T3

- If you have r12 gloves, do not get T3 gloves.
- If you have r10 head and shoulders, swap them both for T3 last.
- If you need to break 8/8 T2, read below.
- Break 3/8 T2 only if you can equip 2 new pieces of T3.
- Ideally equip T3 in this order (biggest upgrade -> smallest):
  - Head, Shoulders, Chest, Belt, Gloves, Bracers, Boots, Legs
- Get ring whenever you can.

T3 armor has a DPS boost at 2 and 4 piece set bonus.  Some of y'all may be coming into phase 6 wearing 8/8 T2.  Breaking T2 for any 2 pieces of T3 is a personal DPS boost.  If you have 3-5 hunters in the raid, switching to 2/8 T3 will boost your personal DPS at the sacrifice of ~10-20 raid DPS from not giving T2 to your other hunters; breaking T2 for any 4 pieces of T3 is both a personal and raid DPS increase.

## Less Succinctly

| Current Set | T3 Piece Gearing Order | Set Breakpoints to Equip |
|---|---|---|

# Ranged Weapons

| Weapon | DPS | MW DPS<sup>[1](#mw-numbers)</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nerubian Slavemaker | +94 | +88 |
| Ashjre'thul | +57 | +52 |
| Larvae of the Great Worm | +34 | +33 |
| Soulstring | +21 | +20 |
| Crossbow of Imminent Doom | +19 | +21 |
| Polished Ironwood Crossbow | +17 | +15 |
| Huhuran's Stinger | +11 | -26 |
| Dragonbreath Hand Cannon | +6 | -20 |
| R14 Xbow/Gun | +3 | |
| Rhok'delar | Baseline <!--1148--> | Baseline <!--1280--> |

Attempting to itemize BiS sets around using the dwarf or troll weapon skill racials with P6 armor is always a DPS loss due to the abundant hit on T3, ZG enchants, and ranged stat stick weapons.  Non-BiS sets may be able to make use of these passives.

<a name="mw-numbers">1</a>: Melee weaving numbers are relative to weaving with Rhok'delar; although the relative DPS increases appear smaller, the absolute DPS of normal melee weaving with any of these weapons is higher than not weaving at all.  Additionally, these numbers are for normal weaving, not max weaving.  Max weaving numbers vary dramatically depending on the speed of the melee weapon used (see the next table).  If you happen to have a plethora of weaving weapons and need to know which will pair best with a given ranged weapon for max weaving, consult the sim.

# Melee Weapons

Some hunters floated the idea of weaving with dual-wielded weapons in phase 6 due to the introduction of Consecrated Sharpening Stones.  We were unable to build a set for which this beat 2 handers at melee weaving with many different combinations of slow mainhands, Windfury on MH, Orc racial, etc.  Slow 2 handers are far and away better for weaving.

## Melee Weaving Weapon DPS

| Weapon | Normal Weave | Max Weave | Max with WCB |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eye of Nerub | +57 <!--1368--> | +47 <!--1407--> | +85 <!--1445--> |
| Severence _(Orc)_ <sup>[1](#severance)</sup> | +40 | +60 | +54 |
| Barb of the Sand Reaver | +40 <!--1351--> | +27 <!--1387--> | +63 <!--1423--> |
| Corrupted Ashbringer | +40 <!--1351--> | +42 <!--1402--> | +61 <!--1431--> |
| Claymore of Unholy Might | +30 <!--1341--> | +28 <!--1388--> | +57 <!--1417--> |
| Severence | +26 <!--1337--> | +26 <!--1386--> | +54 <!--1414--> |
| Gri'leks Carver _(Dragonkin)_ | +33 <!--1344--> | -5 <!--1355--> | +43 <!--1403--> |
| Ashkandi | +23 <!--1334--> | +19 <!--1379--> | +48 <!--1408--> |
| Zin'rokh | +20 <!--1331--> | -2 <!--1358--> | |
| Huntsman's Harpoon | +17 <!--1328--> | +2 <!--1362--> | |
| Lok'delar / Peacemaker | +4 <!--1315--> | +11 <!--1371--> | |
| Barbarous Blade | Baseline <!--1311--> | Baseline <!--1360--> | |

This table changes very little from phase 5 to phase 6 for normal weavers.  For max weaving hunters, the faster attack speed on KT xbow actually shifts the relative strength of a couple weapons, favoring weapons which delay your max weave rotation less.  This is most apparent in that Gril'leks actually loses out to Ashkandi--with and without Warchief's Blessing, even against Dragonkin--due to its insanely slow speed delaying your ranged shots. 

<a name="severance">1</a>: [Severance](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22815/severance) is a 3.6 speed 2 handed axe with 43 strength and 2% crit.  In the contrived setting we're simming things in, [using Severance and putting a hitscope onto your Nerubain Slavemaker](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/cu7DhXxuLdRSsQsvEtN1Z9) is technically the best max weaving gear set for an Orc with Windfury.  It beats Eye of Nerub by 2 DPS if you have Windfury but loses to Nerub when both sets have WCB by ~3 DPS.  It drastically loses to Eye as soon as your max weave uptime dips from 100% (which will happen in any fight you proc Quick Shots or use Rapid Fire during).  

## Ranged Stat Stick Weapon eAP

The six best stat stick weapons this phase all have 1% hit on them.  Hell, Kingsfall is so good that it still beats Hatchet of Sundered Bone's eAP without factoring in hit.  The hit gained on these is far more efficient than getting hit from rings.  As such, ranged hunters will transition into getting 2% of their hit from their weapons this phase.

While the weapons below are our BiS this phase, the first 5 are all also empirically better upgrades for equally performing melee than hunters.  Showing this list to your raid lead and demanding any of them is silly, but we're also not your parents and different raids function differently.  If you are able to secure prio and eventually get your hands on any of them, congrats!  Do put yourself in other's shoes though, and realize how frustrated you would be if Nerubian Slavemaker (warrior BiS btw) went to a melee over you.  _Work with your raid leaders, loot council, and melee to find compromises that suit all of you._

| Weapon | Base | Kings | ZG | Kings + ZG |
|---|---|---|---|---|
Kingsfall | 132 | 138 | 142 | 149
Harbinger of Doom | 109 | 114 | 117 | 120
Iblis, Blade of the Fallen Seraph | 115 |  |  | 
Claw of the Frost Wyrm (OH) | 107 |  |  | 
Blessed Qiraji Pugio | 105 |  |  | 
Maexxna's Fang | 84 |  |  | 
Eye of Nerub<sup>[1](#two-handed)</sup> | 124 | 137 | 144 | 159 |
Hatchet of Sundered Bone | 77 |  |  | 
Barb of the Sand Reaver<sup>[1](#two-handed)</sup> | 113 | 125 | 131 | 145
Silithid Claw (MH) | 71 |  |  | 
Brutality Blade | 65 | 68 | 70 | 74
Hakkari MH / Fang of the Faceless / R14 | 69 |  |  | 
Core Hound Tooth / Ancient Qiraji Ripper | 61 |  |  | 
Tooth of Eranikus (MH) | 48 |  |  | 
16 agi weapons<sup>[2](#agi-weapons)</sup> | 44 | 49 | 51 | 56
Dal'Rend's Set (each) | 45 |  |  | 
1% crit weapons<sup>[3](#crit-weapons)</sup> | 40 |  |  | 
Bone Slicing Hatchet | 36 | 40 | 41 | 46

<a name="two-handed">1</a>: _Two handed weapons should be compared at half their AP.  They will perform even worse than this table shows due to getting 5 less agility from enchants and 100 less AP from a second Consecrated Sharpening Stone._

<a name="agi-weapons">2</a>: _Dragonfang Blade / Doom's Edge / Scythe of the Unseen Path_

<a name="crit-weapons">3</a>: _Assassination Blade / Dawn's Edge / Heartseeker / Thekal's Grasp (MH) / Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge (MH)_

# Rings

Figuring out how to accurately convey the value of different rings was difficult.  In the end, we've decided to include both a raw data table of ring eAP and a TLDR style ring pair eAP table by the amount of hit you need.

## TLDR ring sets:

_The more hit you get from rings, the generally worse the other stats on the rings are.  Get your hit from gear, weapons, and hitscope sooner than rings._

| Hit | Rings | | Ally eAP | Horde eAP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | BoR | RotCS | 224 | 204 |
| | BoR | BoUF | 212 | 201 |
| | BoR | RotG | 214 | 194 |
| | RotCS | BoUF | 198 | 189 |
| | RotCS | RotG | 200 | 182 |
| | BoUF | RotG | 188 | 179 |
| **1** | BoR | BoUF | 212<!--261--> | 201<!--250--> |
| |  BoR | SRotBD | 203<!--252--> | 192<!--241--> |
| | RotCS | BoUF | 198<!--247--> | 189<!--238--> |
| | RotCS | SRotBD | 189<!--238--> | 180<!--229--> |
| | RotG | BoUF | 188<!--237--> | 179<!--228--> |
| | RotG | SRotBD | 179<!--228--> | 170<!--219--> |
| **2** | BoUF | SRotBD | 177<!--275--> | 170<!--268--> | 
| | BoA | BoR | 175<!--273--> | 160<!--258--> |

The above table was generated by pairing reasonably strong rings from the below table and then subtracting their eAP by required hit's value in eAP.  This normalizes eAP values bloated by hit which you ideally should be seeking from other places. 

FAQ:
- Why is Band of Accuria last?
  - BoA is very, very bad eAP for hunters compared to other classes.  Hit comes easy to us--especially in phase 6--and none of the top sets need more than a single % hit from rings.
- Why no 3 hit ring sets?
  - Hitscope your Slavermaker and use a 0 hit ring set.

|  |  | rha | rna | mha | mna | m2a | rhh | rnh | mhh | mnh | m2h |

R = ranged, MW = melee weaving, eAPnH is eAP without factoring in hit, eAP.2H is eAP factoring in .2% hit if the ring is used to hitcap with Eye of Nerub.  This table probably isn't very useful to most but its here.

Ring of Fury, Ring of Qiraji Fury, and Seal of the Gurubashi Berserker were dropped from the list as they arn't very good.

# Trinkets

Slayer's Crest is pretty good.  Leave Kiss to melee, we don't scale well with haste (its probably worse than ES/Jom).  Will fill this out with eAP in the coming days.
